# How to get first 5 users (and convert them to customers) 5Ô∏è‚É£üì≤ü•≥

---

- You've launched a new app üöÄ
- Now what?

---

# Product development lifecycle 

1. Idea üí°
2. Launch something üöÄ
<!-- this is also called "marketing" -->
<!-- also works for finding a job -->
3. Talk to users to see if it serves their needs üó£Ô∏è <--- you're here now
4. Repeat üîÅ

---

<!-- you've already written personas of your target user -->
<!-- if you've built a tool for yourself, find more people like you -->


# 1. Write down a list of all your contacts üìá
- social üì±
    - all followers you can *directly* message
    - Instagram
    - Facebook
    - Linkedin
    - etc.
- email üìß
- phone numbers üìû

---

# 2. Pick a platform to start üéØ
- Preferably the platform you have the most contacts

---

# 3. What do I say? üó£Ô∏è
- Personalize your message
- Be a human being
- It doesn't matter how, just prove you're not blasting all your contacts

> "Hey, I saw you posted about x movie."
> "Hey, I saw you moved."
> "Hey, I saw you started a new job."

---

# 4. Reach out üëã
- Your goal should be to reach out to 100 people, every single day
- Start with 1, then go from there

---

# 5. What do I say if they reply? ü§î
- ACA (Acknowledge Compliment Ask)

1. **Acknowledge** - acknowledge something they've done recently
2. **Compliment** - compliment them
3. **Ask** - ask a question that relates to compliment and what you're selling

- Remember be a human first!
- This only works if you're being authentic

---  

# 6. Invite their friends üë•
- You are not going to sell *this* person

- why?
    - expands list of potential leads
    - keeps it casual (not high pressure salesy)

---

> "Do you know anyone who is looking for XYZ? I'm opening up a few slots to do exactly that."

- You're asking them for a favor, not to buy from you. It shouldn't feel weird.

- However, if they show *interest* in your service, you've just converted a **Lead** to an **Engaged Lead**

**Lead** - someone you can contact
**Engaged lead** - someone you can contact who has shown interest in what you are selling

# 7. Make it free üéÅ

I'm going to do all this stuff for free as long as you promise to do 3 things:
1. You actually use my service
2. You give me feedback on it
3. Leave a great review (if you think it deserves it)

---

# Why?
1. It will give you practice
2. Your product is probably bad
3. You need to learn how to make it less bad by *lowering barrier to entry*

These "customers" are not paying you money, but they are paying for your service with their *time* and *feedback*.

*There may be hidden barriers to using your product that you didn't anticipate*

<!-- fear, uncertainty, etc. -->

---

# Script #1

>Do you know anybody who is (describe their struggles) looking to (dream outcome) in (time delay)?
>I'm taking on 5 case studies for free because that's all I can handle
>I just want to get some testimonials for my product

(this is your first app and you don't know what you're doing so 5 is plenty)

>I just had a girl named (xxx) work with me to get (dream outcome) even though she (describe struggle).
>I'd like to get more testimonials to show it works across different scenarios.
>Does anyone you know come to mind?

---

# Script #2

>I helped (type of customer) get (dream outcome) in (time period) without effort and sacrifice and I guarantee (xyz) to decrease risk.

- If people don't want to work with you (even for free) that means there are hidden costs associated with your service. You need to figure out those hidden costs.

<!-- You've already developed personas so you should know the type of customer to target -->

---

If people get value from your product or service, they are more likely to 
- leave a positive review ‚≠êÔ∏è
- give you feedback üó£Ô∏è
- send friends/family üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶

---

# 9. Start Charging üí∞

- When people start referring, you are good enough to start charging

>I'm taking on 5 case studies for ~~free~~ 80% off because that's all I can handle

- Then keep increasing price

<!-- only limit to price is what market can bear -->

---

# Script #3
- Go back to your free users

>I am accepting somebody who is paying full price in order to do this, if you would like me to keep doing this for you, you would have to start paying to match them. Are you comfortable with that?

- If not, no worries.
    - You just gave them free stuff.
    - Remember to ask for that great review.
- Think long term.

---

These free users are super valuable
1. they're going to leave you reviews
2. they're going to send you people
3. they may transition into customers
<!-- so be nice! -->

---

# 10. Keep leads warm ü•∞

- Keep checking in with your leads and provide them value
  - testimonials
  - samples
  - information/insights/updates
  - etc.
- Leads will start soliciting you

---

# Breakout groups

- Can you use the ACA (acknowlege, compliment, ask) framework to come up with a script?
- Please use breakout rooms to work in small groups (3-5 people) and write a script
- We'll come back as a class and practice pitching each other
